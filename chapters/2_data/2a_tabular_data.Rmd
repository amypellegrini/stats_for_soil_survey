##CHAPTER 2a: TABULAR DATA WE USE

#Getting acquainted with the soilDB package
- Establish an ODBC connection to view NASIS data in R
- Understand the basic structure of pedon data stored in a Soil Profile Collection (SPC)
-	Learn about the checks run by the fetch functions when pulling data into R
-	View a set of pedon data from a selected set in NASIS in R
-	Learn basic commands for inspecting objects and data types
- Learn basic checks that you can do to filter and inspect the consistency of a pedon dataset
-	Joining additional data to an SPC?

#Objectives:
- Use the soilDB package to load NASIS pedon data into R

#Contents:

 * [2.1 ODBC Connection to NASIS](#ODBC)
 * [2.2 Accuracy and Precision](#acc) 
 * [2.3 Preparing data for R](#data)

###<a id="ODBC")></a>2.1  Using the soilDB package to pull NASIS pedon data into R 
 
 **First step - set up an Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) connection to NASIS on your computer**  

Data from a selected set of NASIS may be used as described in this [Job Aid](http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/PA_NRCSConsumption/download?cid=stelprdb1237479&ext=pdf) on “How to Create an ODBC Connection and Setup SoilDB for Use with R”.  

 **Query and load some pedon data into your selected set**
 

###<a id="data")></a>2.3  Preparing data for use in R  

When preparing data for statistical analysis, a nicely formatted summary table is not appropriate. The data needs to be basic and compact.  The required configuration will be a comma delimited text file, where columns contain dependent and independent variables and rows contain individual observations of the variables.  Using sand content as an example, you might collect or present your data like this:

However, for use in R, the data needs to be organized with total sand content as one long column – with headers for organization.  Remove spaces from column headers, and simplify and standardize the coding of categorical variables.  There should be only 1 header row followed by data as noted in this formatted table.

The same table in a format suitable for use by R  

location,landuse,horizon,depth,sand  
city,crop,A,14,19    
city,crop,B,25,21  
city,pasture,A,10,23    
city,pasture,B,27,34  
city,range,A,15,22  
city,range,B,23,23  
farm,crop,A,12,31  
farm,crop,B,31,35  
farm,pasture,A,17,30  
farm,pasture,B,26,36  
farm,range,A,15,25  
farm,range,B,24,29  
west,crop,A,13,27  
west,crop,B,29,25  
west,pasture,A,11,21  
west,pasture,B,31,26  
west,range,A,14,23  
west,range,B,24,24  

If you copy and paste the comma delimited text, starting with the header line of location, and save it as a text file named “sample_table.txt” in the \ C:/Temp\ folder, you can open R and run these commands by copying text from the boxes and pasting into the R prompt:

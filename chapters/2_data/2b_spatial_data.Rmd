# Introduction

Most of us are familiar with spatial data types, sources, and the jargon used to describe interaction with these data. GIS software provides a convenient framework for most of the spatial analysis that we do, however, the combination of statistical routines, advanced graphics, and data access functionality make *R* and ideal environment for soil science. For example, with a couple of lines of *R* code, it is possible to quickly integrate soil morphology (NASIS), lab data (KSSL), map unit polygons (SSURGO), and climate data (PRISM raster files). 

This chapter is a very brief demonstration of several possible ways to process spatial data in R. A much more thorough description can be found in [*Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R*](http://www.asdar-book.org/) (Bivand et al., 2013) or [*Spatial Data Analysis and Modeling with R*](http://rspatial.org/spatial/) (Hijmans, 2016).


## Objectives
 * Gain experience with creating, editing, and exporting spatial data objects in R.
 * Lean the basics of the `sp` classes and functions.
 * Learn the basics of the `raster` classes and functions.
 * Develop a strategy for navigating the many possible spatial data processing methods.
 * Learn how to integrate multiple data sources to create something new.
 

# Spatial Data in R

There are several foundational libraries that extend the basic functionality of the R environment to accommodate the special requirements of spatial data:

 * `sp`: vector / raster storage and processing (memory-bound operations)
 * `raster`: raster access and efficient processing of large files (not memory-bound)
 * `rgdal`: interface to GDAL library for data import/export and coordinate system transformations
 
There are [many, many more packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html) available for working with spatial data, however we only have time to cover the above libraries. 
 

The next couple of sections will require loading these libraries into the R session.
```{r}
library(sp)
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
```

If you haven't yet done so, please setup the sample datasets for this module.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# make a place to store chapter 2b example data
dir.create('C:/workspace/chapter-2b', recursive = TRUE)

# download example data from github
# polygons
download.file('https://github.com/ncss-tech/stats_for_soil_survey/raw/master/data/chapter_2b-spatial-data/chapter-2b-mu-polygons.zip', 'C:/workspace/chapter-2b/chapter-2b-mu-polygons.zip')

# raster data
download.file('https://github.com/ncss-tech/stats_for_soil_survey/raw/master/data/chapter_2b-spatial-data/chapter-2b-PRISM.zip', 'C:/workspace/chapter-2b/chapter-2b-PRISM.zip')

# unzip
unzip('C:/workspace/chapter-2b/chapter-2b-mu-polygons.zip', exdir = 'C:/workspace/chapter-2b', overwrite = TRUE)
unzip('C:/workspace/chapter-2b/chapter-2b-PRISM.zip', exdir = 'C:/workspace/chapter-2b', overwrite = TRUE)
```




## The `sp` Library and Classes

The data structures ("classes") and functions provided by the [`sp`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/index.html) package have served a foundational role in the handling of spatial data in R. Many of the following examples will reference names such as `SpatialPoints`, `SpatialPointsDataFrame`, and `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame`. These are specialized classes, implemented by the `sp` package, that maintain linkages between all of the components of spatial data. For example, a point, line, or polygon feature will typically be associated with:
 
 * coordinate geometry
 * bounding box
 * coordinate reference system
 * attribute table


Load some of the chapter 2 sample data for a simple demonstration of the `SpatialPolyhonsDataFrame` class.
```{r}
mlra <- readOGR('C:/workspace/chapter-2b/)

```

See the [sp gallery](https://edzer.github.io/sp/) and vignettes [1](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/vignettes/intro_sp.pdf) [2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/vignettes/over.pdf) for a much more detailed description of the `sp` classes and associated spatial operations.

```{r }
p <- SpatialPoints(cbind(-97.721210, 40.446068))

Note: `sp` is being re-written as part of the `sf` library.

# Raster Data

The raster format is a common GIS format designed primarily for displaying continuous data. The format is similar to matrices in R, although it contains additional information, such as spatial projection and resolution. R and many other GIS, including ArcGIS, use the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) to import raster data. GDAL supports a wide variety of raster formats. Popular formats include GeoTIFF (.tif) and Erdas Imagine (.img), but exclude rasters stored in ESRI's propriety file geodatabase format. Either the `readGDAL()` or `raster()` function can be used to import raster data. These functions are from the rgdal and raster packages respectively. The raster package is preferred for working with large raster datasets because it doesn't require reading the raster files into the computer's random access memory (RAM). The raster package also contains a wider variety of functions similar to those found in the ArcGIS Spatial Analyst extension.

## Importing Raster Data With the `raster` Package

```{r raster, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Example importing raster data

library(sp)
library(rgdal)
library(raster)
library(gdalUtils)

f <- system.file("external/tahoe_lidar_highesthit.tif", package="gdalUtils") # pointer to example raster file

# import raster data using the raster package
r <- raster(f)

str(r, max.level = 2)
proj4string(r) # get or set the coordinate reference system
bbox(r) # get bounding box

plot(r)
```

## Stacking Rasters

Multiple sets of raster data can be loaded and then stacked using the `stack()` function in the `raster` package.  Note that a number will be appended onto rasters with the same name to make the names unique within the raster stack.

```{r}
# create a raster stack of multiple rasters - in this case we are stacking the 'f' raster on top of itself
# note names in the plot of this raster stack
s <- stack(f, f) 

plot(s)
```

## Importing Raster Data With the `rgdal` Package

```{r raster1, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## import raster data using the rgdal package
r2 <- readGDAL(f)

str(r2, max.level = 2)

## sp package plotting method based on lattice package
spplot(r2) 
```

## Exporting Raster Data

```{r raster2, eval= TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# raster package
# for large datasets the progress option is helpful
writeRaster(r, filename = "C:/workspace/test.tif", format = "GTiff", progress = "text", overwrite = TRUE) 

# rgdal package: example syntax for exporting a raster
# writeGDAL(r2, fname = "C:/workspace/test.tif", drivername = "GTiff")
```

# Vector Data

The vector format is a common GIS format designed for displaying points, lines, and polygons. To import vector files, R uses the rgdal package, which is a wrapper for GDAL. During the import process, R converts all vector files to its own format, which is a complicated series of lists. This conversion means R is impractical for handling large vector datasets. However, R can call other GIS and spatial databases, such as SAGA, GRASS, and PostGIS.

## Importing Vector Data

```{r}
# load libraries
library(sp)
library(rgdal)

pol <- readOGR(dsn = "C:/workspace/ca794.shp", layer = "ca794")

str(pol, max.level  = 2)
proj4string(pol)
bbox(pol)

plot(pol, axes = TRUE)
```

## Accessing Vector Tabular Data

Tabular data associated with a vector layer can be accessed via the `@data` slot within the `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` object.  You can use the `head()` function to look at the columns in the data.

```{r}
# access tabular data table for vector data using '@data' slot
head(pol)
```


## Exporting Vector Data
```{r}
# export vector data
writeOGR(pol, dsn = "C:/workspace/test.shp", layer = "test", driver = "ESRI Shapefile", overwrite_layer = TRUE)
```


# Reprojecting Data

Typically, you will need to reproject a file before you can combine it with another. You can reproject using either the `spTranform()` function for sp objects or the `projectRaster()` function for raster objects. For large raster files, however, the raster package is slow; so it's better to either call another GIS or spatial databases via R or reproject the files manually in a GIS.

A catalog of spatial reference systems that are compatible with R and ArcGIS can be seen at [spatialreference.org](http://spatialreference.org/) or [http://epsg.io/](http://epsg.io/). Generally, it is simplest to use the EPSG code to specify the reference system; otherwise, you have to manually specify the projection, ellipsoid, and datum. 

```{r}
# reproject polygons

proj4string(pol) # get the original projection

CRS("+init=epsg:5070") # get a projection using the EPSG code

pol2 <- spTransform(pol, CRS("+init=epsg:26911")) # reproject the pol SpatialPolygonsDataFrame to NAD83 UTM Zone 11
```


The standard projection for point data in NASIS and Web Soil Survey is now long/lat WGS84 (i.e., EPSG code 4326). This is a geographic coordinate system. It projects the Earth as a sphere and measures distances in decimal degrees. Many spatial operations are necessary to use a projected coordinate system, which projects the Earth as a flat surface and measures distances in meters. All projected coordinate systems distort the Earth's surface to some degree. Within the continental U.S., a good choice is the USA Contiguous Albers Equal Area Conic USGS projection, which corresponds with EPSG code 5070.


# Extracting Spatial Data

When using soil survey data, you're typically interested in the values for spatial data that overlap point locations or polygons. This gives you information on the geomorphic setting of soil observations. You can then use this information to make predictions about the spatial distribution of soil properties or classes at unobserved sites (e.g., raster cells). The procedure for extracting spatial data at point locations is a simple process of intersecting the point coordinates with the spatial data and recording their values. This can be accomplished with almost any GIS program, including R.

Before you can extract spatial data for the purpose of spatial prediction, the data must meet the following conditions:  

 - All data conforms to a common projection and datum,
 - All raster data have a common cell resolution, and
 - All raster data are co-registered, that is, the geographic coordinates of cell centers are the same for all layers. Setting the _Snap Raster_ in the ArcGIS Processing Environment prior to the creation of raster derivatives can ensure cell alignment. An ERDAS model is also available to perform this task.  


## R Tools for Extracting Spatial Data

To extract point data using R, you can use either the `sp` or `raster` packages. For large raster data sets, it is best to use the `extract()` function from the raster package.

The following example takes pedon data locations from the CA794 soil survey, filters out pedons that are missing coordinates, and creates a `SpatialPointsDataFrame` object.  Rasters of 30-m elevation and slope are then imported and stacked. The `extract()` function is used to intersect the raster values at the pedon point locations.

```{r r_point_extract, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# load libraries
library(soilDB)
library(raster)

# fetch pedon data
p <- fetchNASIS()

# extract site level data
s <- site(p)

# create an index to filter out pedons that are missing coordinates in WGS84
idx <- complete.cases(s[c("x", "y")]) 
# subset pedon using idx
p2 <- p[idx] 

# set the coordinates to the pedon object
coordinates(p2) <- ~ x + y 
# set the projection of the pedon object
proj4string(p2) <- CRS("+init=epsg:4326")
# extract a SpatialPointsDataFrame 
p_sp <- as(p2, "SpatialPointsDataFrame") 
# 
# set working directory for output
setwd("M:/geodata/project_data/8VIC/")

# create a raster stack
rs <- stack(c(elev = "ned30m_8VIC.tif", slope = "ned30m_8VIC_slope5.tif"))
# assign projection to the raster stack
proj4string(rs) <- CRS("+init=epsg:5070")

# extract data from the stack 
test <- data.frame(p_sp$site_id, extract(rs, p_sp)) 

# save output data table as .Rdata file
 save(p, p_sp, test, file = "C:/workspace/ca794_pedons.Rdata")
```


```{r}
load(file = "C:/workspace/ca794_pedons.Rdata")

summary(test)
```

### Exercise 1: Extracting Spatial Data

Using your own point data, extract the raster values for several pedons.

Submit the results to your coach.


## ArcGIS Tools for Extracting Spatial Data: Extracting Point Data from a Raster

This section discusses the use of the "Extract Multi Values to Points" tool, which assigns the cell value of specified raster data sets to existing points. The "Extract Values to Points" and "Sample" tools achieve similar results. These tools are described in the ESRI help section [An Overview of the Extraction Tools](http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#/An_overview_of_the_Extraction_tools/009z00000028000000/).  

To start, assume you have 50 observations across an area of interest in an ArcGIS point file that has numerous observed soil properties. In your analysis, you will also consider such variables as slope, profile curvature, solar insolation, topographic wetness index, relative position, and elevation.
 
The Extract Multi Values to Points tool is the most expedient way to populate raster values to a point file. If your spatial extent is large and you have many raster layers; e.g., 12, it may be best to proceed using 3 or 4 rasters at a time and running the tool 3 or 4 times.  

The **Extract Multi Values to Points** tool is in the **Extraction** tool box in **Spatial Analyst Tools.**  

![R GUI image](figure/ch2_fig3.jpg)  

Select your point file and the associated raster files of interest as noted in the following graphic.  

![R GUI image](figure/ch2_fig4.jpg)  

The resulting point file has the corresponding cell values for slope, profile curvature, and wetness index attached to the point file as columns in the shapefile table.  

![R GUI image](figure/ch2_fig5.jpg)  

The resulting point file may also be saved as a text file for use in R.

Gathering statistics of raster data cells for polygon data sets like SSURGO is typically achieved by the use of the *Zonal Statistics as Table* function from the *Spatial Analyst toolbox*. The output will be a tabular summary for the specified *Zone*, usually map unit symbol or individual polygons.  

Example for summarizing by Map Unit Symbol:  

Open the Zonal Statistics as Table Tool in the Zonal Toolbox.

The input zone field is MUSYM and the input raster is slope:

Which produces a table with the following output:

The use of the Mean and Standard Deviation are acceptable, provided the distributions are close to normal and the interest is in summarizing the entire population of map units. To get a closer look at individual polygons, summarize using the FID:

Which produces a table with the following output:

Use the Join capability to associate the table of statistics to the spatial data:

Which lets you view results by polygon and search for outliers or polygons that require further investigation:

In this example, 4 polygons of *ChC2*, *Coshocton silt loam, 6 to 15 percent slopes, eroded*, have an average slope greater than 15 percent. Discrepancies like this will need to be investigated and resolved.

In another example using a Box plot for assessment of a map unit with a slope class of 15 to 25 percent slopes, indicates half of the polygons with an average slope less than 15 percent:

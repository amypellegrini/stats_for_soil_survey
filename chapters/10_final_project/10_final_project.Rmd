The final project will give you an opportunity to put the classroom experience to work with ready access to instructors. There will be ample time to work on the project during the final day of class in Lincoln. A brief document describing your project will be required for completion of the class. The broad topics below can be used as a guide in organizing the document. 


## Select a project area

Project Domain - could be confined to analysis of pedon data, horizons, lab data from KSSL, point data and any associated variables from NASIS or ad hoc sources, or include a spatial component and resulting predictions. You are strongly encouraged to select a project of interest to your local office.

Guidelines if using spatial data

Area of local interest

If you intend to work on local data with spatial data as a component of the investigation, be prepared to develop all of the associated data layers. Data needs to share a common projection, resolution, extent, GDAL format (ideally img or tiff), be modest in extent (~2,000 x 2,000 cells) and be co-registered. **Ideally, this GIS work should be completed prior to the first day of class**. 

Area from the "Statistics for Soil Survey class"

If you choose to use a project area from one of the classroom examples, spatial data will be available.

## Objective(s)

Describe what you will investigate (soil properties, soil classes, both, eco-sites, etc) and the methods that will be employed. The most critical portion of the exercise is determining what will you do and why is it important.

Apply techniques learned in the part of the course you're enrolled in.

  * __Part 1 :__ Use techniques from chapter 1 - 4
  * _Part 2:_ Use techniges from chapter 1 - 4 AND 5 - 8. 

## Results

Describe results using descriptive and graphical techniques. If predictions are used, include these.

## Discussion

Discuss how these results: 

   1. help in understanding the problem and
   2. influence current and future investigations

## Due Date

January 4, 2019

## Formatting
You can compile your final project report using several methods. Note that copying/pasting from R to Word will often corrupt code that contains single or double quotes. The R-based formats are quite simple and allow you to seamlessly combine narrative, code, output, and figures into a self-contained HTML file. [Note about reproduceable research here.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160).

## Modified from portions of R. Brown script

## Step 1## Edit path and file name as needed

Dataset <- read.table("C:/WorkSpace/input_clhs.csv",header=TRUE, sep=",", na.strings="NA", dec=".", strip.white=TRUE)

## Number of rows in frame*##

nrow(Dataset)

attach(Dataset)

##Step 2##

##Conditional Latin Hypercube Sampling - edit number of samples and iterations as needed

res <- clhs(Dataset, size = 300, iter = 1000, progress = FALSE, simple = FALSE)

##Calls Values that will be Sampled part of the clhs Model for Samplling

res

## Plots the iterations Objective Function vs Iterations and kernal density of Sampled Vs. Original Data##

plot(res, modes = c("obj", "dens"))

## Interfaces Object "res" into are framework##

attach(res)

##creates an object "points" of the sampled data from "cLHS"

point = res$sampled_data

##Creates Coordinates to a table from the "points" object

coordinates = coordinates(point)

## Dump to text file - Edit path and file name as needed

write.table(point, file = "C:/WorkSpace/output_clhs.txt", sep = ",", col.names = NA, qmethod = "double")

###<a id="datatype")></a>2.1  Data Type   

Refers to the _measurement scale_ used. Four measurement scales, in order of decreasing precision are recognized:  

**Ratio** - Measurements having a constant interval size and a true zero point. Examples include measurements of length, weight, volume, rates, length of time, counts of items and temperature in Kelvin  

**Interval** - Measurements having a constant interval size but no true zero point. Examples include Temperature (excluding Kelvin), direction (e.g. slope aspect), time of day. Specific statistical procedures are available to handle circular data like slop aspect  

**Ordinal** - Members of a set are differentiated by rank. Examples include Soil interpretation classes (e.g., slight, moderate, severe), soil structure grade (e.g.,structureless, weak, moderate, strong)  

**Nominal** (Categorical) - Members of a set are differentiated by kind. Examples include Vegetation classes, soil map units, geologic units  

The data type controls the type of statistical operation that can be performed [(Stevens)](#ref), 1946.  

####Continuous and Discrete Data 

**Continuous Data** - Any measured value. Data with a possible value between any observed range. For example, the depth of an Ap horizon could range from 20cm to 30cm, with an infinite number of values between, limited only by the precision of the measurement device  

**Discrete Data** - Data with exact values. For example, the number of Quercus alba seedlings observed in a square meter plot, the number of legs on a dog, the presence/absence of a feature or phenomenon  

###<a id="acc")></a>2.2  Accuracy and Precision  

**Accuracy** is the closeness of a number to its actual value  

**Precision** is the closeness of repeated measurements to each other  

####Significant Figures  

The digits in a number that define the accuracy of a measurement. The value of 6 cm has one significant digit. The implied range is 1 cm. The true value lies between 5.50 and 6.49. The value of 6.2 cm has two significant digits. The implied range is 0.1 cm. The true value lies between 6.150 and 6.249. The implied accuracy is greater for the number 6.0 cm than 6 cm.  

###<a id="data")></a>2.3  Preparing data for use in R  

When preparing data for statistical analysis, a nicely formatted summary table is not appropriate. The data needs to be basic and compact.  The required configuration will be a comma delimited text file, where columns contain dependent and independent variables and rows contain individual observations of the variables.  Using sand content as an example, you might collect or present your data like this:  

![R GUI image](ch2jpg/ch2_fig1.jpg)  

However, for use in R, the data needs to be organized with total sand content as one long column – with headers for organization.  Remove spaces from column headers, and simplify and standardize the coding of categorical variables.  There should be only 1 header row followed by data as noted in this formatted table.  
![R GUI image](ch2jpg/ch2_fig2.jpg)  

The same table in a format suitable for use by R  

location,landuse,horizon,depth,sand  
city,crop,A,14,19    
city,crop,B,25,21  
city,pasture,A,10,23    
city,pasture,B,27,34  
city,range,A,15,22  
city,range,B,23,23  
farm,crop,A,12,31  
farm,crop,B,31,35  
farm,pasture,A,17,30  
farm,pasture,B,26,36  
farm,range,A,15,25  
farm,range,B,24,29  
west,crop,A,13,27  
west,crop,B,29,25  
west,pasture,A,11,21  
west,pasture,B,31,26  
west,range,A,14,23  
west,range,B,24,24  

If you copy and paste the comma delimited text, starting with the header line of location, and save it as a text file named “sample_table.txt” in the \ C:/Temp\ folder, you can open R and run these commands by copying text from the boxes and pasting into the R prompt:  

**Using data from NASIS**  

Data from a selected set of NASIS may be used as described in this [Job Aid](http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/PA_NRCSConsumption/download?cid=stelprdb1237479&ext=pdf) on “How to Create an ODBC Connection and Setup SoilDB for Use with R”.  

**Using data from associated raster layer**  

Assume you have 50 observations across your area of interest contained in a point file in ArcGIS with numerous observed soil properties. You would also like to consider variables like slope, profile curvature, solar insolation, topographic wetness index, relative position and elevation in your analysis. Before proceeding, it is preferable to meet the following conditions:  

 - All data conforms to a common projection and datum
 - All raster data have a common cell resolution
 - All raster data are co-registered, that is, the geographic coordinates of cell centers are the same for all layers. Setting the Snap Raster in the ArcGIS Processing Environment prior to the creation of raster derivatives can insure cell alignment. An ERDAS model is also available to perform this task.  
 
Using Extract Multi Values to Points is the most expedient way to populate raster values to a point file. _If your spatial extent is large and you have many raster layers, e.g. 12, it may be best to proceed using 3 or 4 rasters at a time and running the tool 3 or 4 times_.  

The Extract Multi Values to Points is found in the Extraction Tool Box in Spatial Analyst Tools

Select your point file and the associated raster files of interest as noted in the example graphic  

![R GUI image](ch2jpg/ch2_fig4.jpg)  

The resulting point file will have the corresponding cell values for slope, profile curvature and wetness index attached to the point file:

Save the point file as a text file for use in R.
